     ## üìö Bookshelf

     Let's dive into my collection of literature, from physical books to digital books and journal papers that have piqued my interest in computational biology and population genetics.

     ### Physical Books

     Here are some books that provide valuable insights into population genetics and mathematical modeling in biology:

     1. "Population Genetics: A Concise Guide" by John H. Gillespie
     2. "An Introduction to Population Genetics: Theory and Applications" by Richard Halliburton Michod
     3. "Population Genetics and Microevolutionary Theory" by Alan R. Templeton
     4. "Principles of Population Genetics" by Daniel L. Hartl and Andrew G. Clark
     5. "A Biologist's Guide to Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Evolution" by Sarah P. Otto and Troy Day
     6. "Modeling Life: The Mathematics of Biological Systems" by Alan Garfinkel, Jane Shevtsov, and Yina Guo

     ### Digital Books

     A couple of excellent digital books on population genetics that are just a click away:

     1. [Applied Population Genetics](https://dyerlab.github.io/applied_population_genetics/index.html)
     2. [Joseph Felsenstein's Book](https://github.com/shashankpritam/PopGen/blob/main/pdf_books/FELSENSTEIN.pdf)
     3. [Kent Holsinger's Book](https://github.com/shashankpritam/PopGen/blob/main/pdf_books/KentHolsinger.pdf)
     4. [Warren Ewens's Book](https://github.com/shashankpritam/PopGen/blob/main/pdf_books/ewens.pdf)

     ### Journal Papers

     Some fascinating research papers that have recently caught my eye:

     1. [Kapheim, K. M., et al. (2019). "Draft Genome Assembly and Population Genetics of an Agricultural Pollinator, the Solitary Alkali Bee (Halictidae: Nomia melanderi)". G3 Genes|Genomes|Genetics](https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.118.200865)
