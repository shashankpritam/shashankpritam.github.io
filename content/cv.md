## OBJECTIVE

Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at North Dakota State University (NDSU), enrolled in the Department of Biological Sciences. My academic journey has been quite enriching for me so far. Computational Biology has been my focus as a research area, mainly because it is quite interdisciplinary. I truly enjoy studying the breadth of the research area, as it gives me opportunities to focus on deep, specific problems while still acquiring new skills and utilizing old ones.

The way I approach a problem is from a software engineer's perspective—to build on skeletal structures. But at the same time, I error-proof my model, code, and project as a mathematician would. Biology is a domain that not only provides me with intellectual satisfaction but also enables me to help society in a way that I can.
In terms of skills and knowledge, I have completed excellent courses ranging from Undergrad Real Analysis to Graduate-level Statistical Machine Learning. Within the domain of computational science, I keep sharpening my Python and R skills, albeit with a narrow focus on data analysis and visualization. In my spare time, I devour great programming articles, books, and podcasts to continue learning. I have also been learning Rust and Go languages.

With my acquired skills and knowledge, I would like to work on projects that are fulfilling to me, such as working on problems that bridge scientific research and industry solutions.
