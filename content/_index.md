title: "At the Intersection of Genetics and Computation"
---

Hey there, welcome to my little corner of the internet!

---

I'm a computational biologist, currently deep in the world of Ph.D. research. I spend my days (and many nights) exploring the fascinating field of population genetics. This website is my space to share, discuss, and connect over the things that get me thinking.

## My Workspace

### Programming

- **Languages**: Python and R have been my staples for a long time, but I've been immersing myself in the worlds of Go and Codon (an exciting variant of Python).
- **IDEs**: I use RStudio, Jupyter Notebook and VS Codium has been a reliable ally for many other languages.
- **Terminals**: iTerm is my terminal of choice. It's sleek, customizable, and very powerful.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub are my tools of choice for version control and collaboration.
- **Shell & Command Line**: I've got a soft spot for Bash, regex, and the simplicity of command-line interfaces.



# My .zshrc Configuration

Here's a look at my `.zshrc` configuration for my Zsh shell setup.

## Theme

I use the `powerlevel10k` theme, which is a fast, highly customizable Zsh theme. 

    ```zsh
    ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
    ```

## Case and Hyphen Sensitivity

In this setup, completion in my shell is case-sensitive and hyphen-insensitive.

    ```zsh
    CASE_SENSITIVE="true"
    HYPHEN_INSENSITIVE="true"
    ```

## Plugins

My Zsh comes with the following plugins:

    ```zsh
    plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting bedtools fig thefuck)
    ```

These plugins enhance my workflow by providing autosuggestions, syntax highlighting, improved Git interaction, and more.

## FZF Integration

FZF, the command-line fuzzy finder, is integrated into my shell. I've also set up some aliases to provide a preview feature for the `ls` command, and to quickly open files in the `micro` editor.

    ```zsh
    alias preview="fzf --preview 'bat --color \"always\" {}'"
    alias vi='micro'
    ```

## Micro Editor

The terminal-based text editor `micro` is set as the default editor in my shell.

    ```zsh
    export EDITOR='micro'
    ```

## Custom Aliases

I've set up custom aliases to streamline my workflow, such as `zshconfig` and `ohmyzsh` for easy access to configuration files, and `hist` to search through my command history using `fzf`.

    ```zsh
    alias zshconfig="micro ~/.zshrc"
    alias ohmyzsh="micro ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme"
    alias hist=fzf_history
    ```

## Neofetch

Neofetch runs at the start of each terminal session, displaying system information with ASCII art.

    ```zsh
    neofetch
    ```

## Git Prompt

My prompt also displays information about my Git repository status, like the branch name and whether there are changes to be committed.

    ```zsh
    ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_PREFIX="%{$fg[blue]%}git:(%{$fg[red]%}"
    ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_SUFFIX="%{$reset_color%} "
    ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_DIRTY="%{$fg[blue]%}) %{$fg[yellow]%}âœ—"
    ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_CLEAN="%{$fg[blue]%})"
    ```

This configuration provides a powerful, user-friendly, and efficient command line environment that boosts my productivity and makes working in the terminal an enjoyable experience. Happy coding!

### Writing

- **Markdown Editor**: Typora is my editor of choice for Markdown. It's clean, it's neat, and it makes writing a breeze.
- **Blogging**: This website is built with Hugo, an open-source static site generator that I adore for its simplicity.
- **Note-Taking**: I rely on Quarto for note-taking and to-do lists. It's versatile and particularly powerful when working with R and has deep integration with Pandoc and LaTex.

## Tools I Can't Live Without

- **Mermaid & D2**: For all my diagram needs. They've made my life a whole lot easier.
- **Termius**: When it comes to remote work, Termius is my best friend. It's a powerful SSH client, and it's saved me more times than I can count.
- **Zotero & Calibre**: My trusted allies in the war against disorganized references and e-books.
- **Pandoc**: The Swiss Army knife of document conversion. I don't know where I'd be without it.

## Eye Care

- **Flux & HazeOver**: These two take care of my eyes during those long hours in front of the screen.

## Github Stars

I've discovered some amazing projects on GitHub, and I've given them a star. You can check them out [here](https://github.com/shashankpritam?tab=stars).
