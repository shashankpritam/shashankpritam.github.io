Hello! Welcome to my blog.

I am a PhD student in the Biological Sciences department at North Dakota State University (NDSU). 

My primary interests lie within the computational domain of Biology, specifically focusing on small RNAs and their structures and functions. 

This blog is a platform for me to discuss various topics that interest me - from different programming languages and operating systems to opinions about diverse subcultures.

:note:

I use Grammarly and local LLMs (especially variants of Mistral) on my computer to fix spelling mistakes, grammar, and writing flow. These tools help me learn how to write better. My goal is that as I progress with my writing, I'll use them less and less after a while.


## My Digital Workspace

### Programming Tools
- **Languages**: Python, R, Go, and Rust. Current obsession : Raku. 
- **IDEs**: Helix editor, Zed, and VS Code.
- **Terminal**: iTerm2 ftw!
- **Version Control**: Currently using GitHub, but planning to transition to [sr.ht](https://sr.ht/~pritam/).
- **Shell & CLI**: I love tools like ripgrep, fzf, fd, and OhMyZsh.

### Writing & Note-Taking
- **Markdown**: Typora for reading and writing on the fly.
- **Note-Taking**: Quarto, integrating seamlessly with R, Jupyter notebook, LaTex, Typst, pandoc and what not!

### Essential Tools
- **Diagrams**: D2.
- **Remote Work**: Termius.
- **Reference Management**: Zotero & Calibre.
- **Document Conversion**: Pandoc.
- **Other Favorites**: Omnivore, Kagi Search, Orion Browser, VS Code, Itsycal.

### Eye Health
- **Screen Comfort**: Flux & HazeOver. These are great tools!

### Devices

- **Kindle**: I don't get to use my Kindle much due to its limitations in form factor and document formats. Once the new Supernote is released, I plan to purchase it as an
alternative. For now, my iPad Gen 9 serves as a useful and budget-friendly device, especially since Zotero and Omnivore work smoothly on it.
