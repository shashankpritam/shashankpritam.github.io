title: "At the Intersection of Genetics and Computation"
---

Hey there, welcome to my little corner of the internet!

---

I'm a computational biologist, currently deep in the world of Ph.D. research. I spend my days (and many nights) exploring the fascinating field of population genetics. This website is my space to share, discuss, and connect over the things that get me thinking.

## My Workspace

### Programming

- **Languages**: Python and R have been my staples for a long time, but I've been immersing myself in the worlds of Go and Codon ( an exciting variant of Python).
- **IDEs**: I use RStudio, Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code has been a reliable ally for many other languages.
- **Terminals**: iTerm is my terminal of choice. It's sleek, customizable, and very powerful.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub are my tools of choice for version control and collaboration.
- **Shell & Command Line**: I've got a soft spot for Bash, regex, and the simplicity of command-line interfaces.

### Writing

- **Markdown Editor**: Typora is my editor of choice for Markdown. It's clean, it's neat, and it makes writing a breeze.
- **Blogging**: This website is built with Hugo, an open-source static site generator that I adore for its simplicity.
- **Note-Taking**: I rely on Quarto for note-taking and to-do lists. It's versatile and particularly powerful when working with R.

## Tools I Can't Live Without

- **Mermaid & D2**: For all my diagram needs. They've made my life a whole lot easier.
- **Termius**: When it comes to remote work, Termius is my best friend. It's a powerful SSH client, and it's saved me more times than I can count.
- **Zotero & Calibre**: My trusted allies in the war against disorganized references and e-books.
- **Pandoc**: The Swiss Army knife of document conversion. I don't know where I'd be without it.
- **Bubbletea**: This fun little library for Go has been an absolute joy to use for building user interfaces in the terminal.

## Eye Care

- **Flux & HazeOver**: These two take care of my eyes during those long hours in front of the screen.

## Github Stars

I've discovered some amazing projects on GitHub, and I've given them a star. You can check them out [here](https://github.com/shashankpritam?tab=stars).
