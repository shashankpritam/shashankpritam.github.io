title: "Statement of Teaching Philosophy"
---


As an educator, my teaching philosophy is centered around creating a balanced power dynamic in the classroom that encourages productivity, nurtures mental health, and promotes an inclusive and welcoming environment. Mental health is as important as physical health and education should never compromise either aspect. My approach is to teach focusing genuine curiosity and accessibility.

### Prioritizing mental health and well-being

A studentâ€™s mental health is very important; my teaching practices reflect this commitment. I aim to create a classroom atmosphere where students feel emotionally supported and valued, this should enable them to focus on learning without added stress or anxiety. I work to provide accommodations and resources for students who may require additional support.

### Creating an inclusive and welcoming environment

Recognizing that students come from diverse backgrounds, I aim to create an inclusive and welcoming classroom environment. I actively promote respect and understanding among students, developing a sense of community, and belonging. I try to ensure that every student feels seen and heard by including diverse perspectives and addressing potential biases in my course materials.

### Encouraging genuine curiosity and engagement

Learning is most effective when students are genuinely curious about the subject matter. Because of this, I design my courses to be engaging and thought-provoking, connecting course content to real-world examples and experiences. I also use various teaching methods and include active learning strategies, making the content accessible and interesting for all students.

### Providing guidance and resources

As an educator, I know my limitations and recognize that I may not always be able to address every question or concern. In such instances, I prioritize guiding students toward relevant and valuable resources through peer-reviewed articles, expert opinions, or supplementary materials. This approach supports their learning journey and helps them to become self-directed learners.
