title: "Statement of Teaching Philosophy"
---

As an educator, my teaching philosophy is centered around fostering a balanced power dynamic in the classroom that encourages productivity, nurtures mental health, and promotes an inclusive and welcoming environment. Mental health is as important as physical health; education should never compromise either aspect. My approach to teaching emphasizes genuine curiosity, accessibility, and guiding students toward valuable resources when necessary.

### Prioritizing mental health and well-being

A studentâ€™s mental health is paramount; my teaching practices reflect this commitment. I strive to create a classroom atmosphere where students feel emotionally supported and valued, enabling them to focus on learning without added stress or anxiety. I encourage open communication about mental well-being and work to provide accommodations and resources for students who may require additional support.

### Creating an inclusive and welcoming environment

Recognizing that students come from diverse backgrounds, I aim to create an inclusive and welcoming classroom environment. I actively promote respect, empathy, and understanding among students, fostering a sense of community, and belonging. I ensure every student feels seen and heard by incorporating diverse perspectives and addressing potential biases in my course materials.

### Encouraging genuine curiosity and engagement

Learning is most effective when students are genuinely curious about the subject matter. To spark this curiosity, I design my courses to be engaging and thought-provoking, connecting course content to real-world examples and experiences. By using various teaching methods and incorporating active learning strategies, I make the content accessible and stimulating for all students.

### Providing guidance and resources

As an educator, I know my limitations and recognize that I may not always be able to address every question or concern. In such instances, I prioritize guiding students toward relevant and valuable resources through peer-reviewed articles, expert opinions, or supplementary materials. This approach supports their learning journey and empowers them to become self-directed learners.

One example of how I put these principles into practice is by regularly checking in with my students about their mental health and well-being. I make it a point to create a safe space for them to express their concerns, and I actively work with them to find appropriate accommodations or solutions to mitigate potential stressors.

In addition, to create genuine curiosity and engagement, I incorporate real-world case studies, group discussions, and interactive activities that encourage students to delve deeper into the subject matter. These methods make learning more enjoyable and help students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Lastly, I acknowledge my limitations as an educator and proactively guide students toward additional resources. By providing them with a curated list of relevant articles, websites, and experts in the field, I ensure they have the tools necessary to excel in their studies and become independent learners.

In conclusion, my teaching philosophy promotes a balanced power dynamic, prioritizes mental health, and fosters an inclusive and engaging learning environment. By incorporating these principles into my teaching practices, I hope to create a positive and supportive educational experience that empowers students to reach their full academic and personal potential.
