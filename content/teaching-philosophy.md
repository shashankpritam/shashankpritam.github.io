title: "Statement of Teaching Philosophy"
---


As an educator, my teaching philosophy is centered around creating a balanced power dynamic in the classroom that encourages productivity, nurtures mental health, and promotes an inclusive and welcoming environment. For me, mental health is as important as physical health and education should never compromise either of aspects.

### Prioritizing mental health and well-being

A studentâ€™s mental health is very important; and my teaching practices reflect this commitment. I aim to create a classroom atmosphere where students feel emotionally supported and valued, this should enable them to focus on learning without added stress. I work to provide accommodations and resources for students who may require additional support.

### Creating an inclusive and welcoming environment

Recognizing that students come from diverse backgrounds, I aim to create an inclusive and welcoming classroom environment. 

### Encouraging genuine curiosity and engagement

I have found that learning is most effective when students are genuinely curious about the subject matter. Thus, I design my courses to be engaging and thought-provoking, connecting course content to real-world examples and experiences.

### Providing guidance and resources

As an educator, I know my limitations and recognize that I may not always be able to address every question or concern. In such instances, I prioritize guiding students toward relevant and valuable resources through peer-reviewed articles, expert opinions, or supplementary materials. **This approach supports their learning journey and helps them to become self-directed learners.**
