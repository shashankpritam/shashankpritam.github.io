title: "Statement of Teaching Philosophy"
---


As an educator, my teaching philosophy is centered around fostering a balanced power dynamic in the classroom that encourages productivity, nurtures mental health, and promotes an inclusive and welcoming environment. Mental health is as important as physical health; education should never compromise either aspect. My approach to teaching emphasizes genuine curiosity, accessibility, and guiding students toward valuable resources when necessary.

### Prioritizing mental health and well-being

A studentâ€™s mental health is paramount; my teaching practices reflect this commitment. I strive to create a classroom atmosphere where students feel emotionally supported and valued, enabling them to focus on learning without added stress or anxiety. I encourage open communication about mental well-being and work to provide accommodations and resources for students who may require additional support.

### Creating an inclusive and welcoming environment

Recognizing that students come from diverse backgrounds, I aim to create an inclusive and welcoming classroom environment. I actively promote respect, empathy, and understanding among students, fostering a sense of community, and belonging. I ensure every student feels seen and heard by incorporating diverse perspectives and addressing potential biases in my course materials.

### Encouraging genuine curiosity and engagement

Learning is most effective when students are genuinely curious about the subject matter. To spark this curiosity, I design my courses to be engaging and thought-provoking, connecting course content to real-world examples and experiences. By using various teaching methods and incorporating active learning strategies, I make the content accessible and stimulating for all students.

### Providing guidance and resources

As an educator, I know my limitations and recognize that I may not always be able to address every question or concern. In such instances, I prioritize guiding students toward relevant and valuable resources through peer-reviewed articles, expert opinions, or supplementary materials. This approach supports their learning journey and empowers them to become self-directed learners.
