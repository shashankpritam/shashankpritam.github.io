===================== aurelien_alvarez_surfaces_in_R8 ==========================

This generator is written in Python.

This code generates points on a family of surfaces living in CP^2. You can move
in the family thanks to the parameter "degre". The parameter "nombrePoints"
allows to choose the number of points on the chosen surface. Finally, to compute
the points, we choose a chart in C^2 and take points randomly in the x-variable,
so that you may also modify the window for x in the complex plane (parameter
"module_x").

After that, the program computes points in C^2, then maps them in R^8, so that
the points live on a surface which is compact (which is not the case for the
intersection of the surface with C^2). We end off with a bunch of points on a
compact surface in R^8.
