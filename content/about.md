## About Me and My Blog

Hello! I'm Shashank Pritam, a PhD student at NDSU. While my PhD journey is in Biological Sciences, my focus is in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.
My research is a thrilling mix of mathematics, biology, technology, and computation.

## What's On The Blog? (Or what I hope to post in future)

* Practical advice on managing and building systems for large-scale genetic data
* Explorations of the latest bioinformatics algorithms and methods
* Reviews and discussions on notable genetics papers
* A mix of whatever's been capturing my interest lately in reading and learning
