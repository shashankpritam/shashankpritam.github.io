      <title>Statement of Teaching Philosophy</title>
      <link>https://www.gomodelbio.systems/teaching-philosophy/</link>

      <description>As an educator, my teaching philosophy is centered around fostering a balanced power dynamic in the classroom that encourages productivity, nurtures mental health, and promotes an inclusive and welcoming environment. Mental health is as important as physical health; education should never compromise either aspect. My approach to teaching emphasizes genuine curiosity, accessibility, and guiding students toward valuable resources when necessary.
Prioritizing mental health and well-being A studentâ€™s mental health is paramount; my teaching practices reflect this commitment.</description>
