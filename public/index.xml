OBJECTIVE Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at North Dakota State University (NDSU), enrolled in the Department of Biological Sciences. My academic journey has been quite enriching for me so far. Computational Biology has been my focus as a research area, mainly because it is quite interdisciplinary. I truly enjoy studying the breadth of the research area, as it gives me opportunities to focus on deep, specific problems while still acquiring new skills and utilizing old ones.</description>

      <title>Statement of Teaching Philosophy</title>

      <description>As an educator, my teaching philosophy is centered around creating a balanced power dynamic in the classroom that encourages productivity, nurtures mental health, and promotes an inclusive and welcoming environment. For me, mental health is as important as physical health and education should never compromise either of aspects.
Prioritizing mental health and well-being A student’s mental health is very important; and my teaching practices reflect this commitment. I aim to create a classroom atmosphere where students feel emotionally supported and valued, this should enable them to focus on learning without added stress.</description>
